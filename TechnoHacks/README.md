Task 1 : Perform Data Cleaning
Clean a dataset by removing missing values and outliers.
Dataset : train.csv

Task 2 : Calculate summary statistics
Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for a dataset
Dataset : train.csv

Task 3 : Visualization using Histogram
Create a histogram or bar chart to visualize the distribution of data in a dataset
Dataset : iris.csv

In Task 3 we are having outliers so we have to remove that 
Removing Outliers :
For removing the outlier, one must follow the same process of removing an entry from the dataset using its exact position in the 
dataset because in all the above methods of detecting the outliers end result is the list of all those data items that satisfy 
the outlier definition according to the method used.
Histograms :
Histograms allow seeing the distribution of data for various columns. It can be used for uni as well as bi-variate analysis.
ðŸ‘‰The highest frequency of the sepal length is between 30 and 35 which is between 5.5 and 6
ðŸ‘‰The highest frequency of the sepal Width is around 70 which is between 3.0 and 3.5
ðŸ‘‰The highest frequency of the petal length is around 50 which is between 1 and 2
ðŸ‘‰The highest frequency of the petal width is between 40 and 50 which is between 0.0 and 0.5
