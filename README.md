### 1. [IMDB Movie Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/sanjanapaluri/Python_project/tree/main/IMDB%20Movie%20Analysis%20Dashboard)

IMDB, the world's largest movie rating platform, plays a crucial role in influencing viewers' movie choices. Many users rely on IMDB ratings, the number of votes, and reviews to decide which movies to watch. The data collected by IMDB is invaluable for understanding public preferences, identifying profitable movie genres, and predicting movie revenue.

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the IMDB dataset to generate insights that can drive revenue in the movie industry. By examining ratings, revenue, genres, and other factors, we aim to answer questions like which genres are most profitable, which genres receive high ratings but lower revenue, and how ratings impact a movie's success.
